# Full_Custom_Landing_Page
My COMPLETELY ORIGINAL Landing Page Project

I don't need to cheat to succeed. And I don't need your little starter code, either. This webpage is dynamic, responsize, and completely written by ME.

- This page will build a navigation bar based on the number of sections present
- The links in the navigation bar will smoothly scroll to the relevant section
- When any section is displayed within the viewport, it will have special styling that distinguishes it from all other sections
